# DMAC memory transfer

This example application demonstrates how to use the DMAC peripheral to do a memory to memory transfer.

## Description

The application uses a software trigger to initiate a memory-memory transfer from the source buffer to the destination buffer with 16-bit beat size and 32-bit beat size. The number of cycles taken for the DMA transfer is measured using the System timer (SysTick) and reported on the console.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_c20_c21) and click

### Setting up [SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamc21n-xpro)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Open the Terminal application (Ex.:Tera term) on the computer
2. Connect to the EDBG Virtual COM port and configure the serial settings as follows:
    - Baud : 115200
    - Data : 8 Bits
    - Parity : None
    - Stop : 1 Bit
    - Flow Control : None
3. Build and Program the application using its IDE
4. LED indicates the success or failure:
    - LED is turned ON when the DMAC memory transfer is successful.
    - Following table provides the LED name

    | Board Name | LED Name |
    |------------| -------- |
    |[SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamc21n-xpro) | LED0 |

5. Observe output message in console as follows:
