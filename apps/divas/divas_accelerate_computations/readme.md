# DIVAS accelerate computations

This example application demonstrates how to use the DIVAS accelerator to compute square room, and perform a division and modulus operation.

## Description

The Divide and Square Root Accelerator (DIVAS) is a programmable 32-bit signed or unsigned hardware divider and a 32-bit unsigned square root hardware engine. The DIVAS takes dividend and divisor values and returns the quotient and remainder when it is used as divider. The DIVAS takes unsigned input value and returns its square root and remainder when it is used as square root function.
