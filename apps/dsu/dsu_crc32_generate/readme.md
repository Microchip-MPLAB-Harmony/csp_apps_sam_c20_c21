# DSU compute CRC32

This example application demonstrates how to use the DSU Peripheral library to compute 32-bit Cyclic Redundancy Checksum (CRC).

## Description

The DSU unit provides support for calculating a 32-bit CRC value for a memory area. This example application computes the 32-bit hardware CRC value using the DSU Peripheral and validates it using a software-calculated CRC value.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_c20_c21) and click

![clone](../../../docs/images/clone.png)

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/dsu/dsu_crc32_generate/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

### Setting up [SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamc21n-xpro)

- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE
2. The LED indicates the success or failure:
    - LED is turned ON when the hardware CRC value matched with the software calculated CRC value
    - LED is turned OFF when the hardware CRC value did not match with the software calculated CRC value

The following table provides the LED name

| Board      | LED Name |
| ---------- | ---------|
| [SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamc21n-xpro) | LED0 |
