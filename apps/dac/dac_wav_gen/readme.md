# DAC waveform generation

This example application shows how to use the DAC to generate a 1 KHz Sine or Sawtooth wave with a lookup table.

## Description

This example application shows how to use the DAC Peripheral library to generate a 1 KHz Sine or Sawtooth wave with lookup table. DAC starts conversion on a trigger from a timer period interrupt configured to occur at every 10 microseconds. In this application, the number of the DAC samples in a lookup table is 100.

## Downloading and building the application

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_c21n_xpro.X | [SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamc21n-xpro)
|||

### Setting up [SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamc21n-xpro)

- Connect an oscilloscope to monitor pin 1 (DAC) of 2-pin header labeled DAC-OUT
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application using its IDE
2. Observe a sine wave of 1 KHz frequency on DAC output pins
3. Press switch to toggle the waveform shape from sine wave to sawtooth wave and back
4. Refer to the below table for dac output pin and switch details:

| Board      | DAC output pins | Switch Name |
| ----------------- |-----------|-------------|
| [SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamc21n-xpro) | pin 1 (DAC) of 2-pin header labeled DAC-OUT) | SW0 |
