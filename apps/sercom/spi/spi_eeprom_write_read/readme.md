# SERCOM SPI EEPROM read write

This example application demonstrates how to use the SERCOM SPI peripheral to write and read from the SPI serial EEPROM memory.

## Description

This example uses the SERCOM SPI peripheral library to write an array of values to the SPI Serial EEPROM and verify the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written.

## Downloading and building the application

To download or clone this application from Github, go to the [top level of the repository](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/csp_apps_sam_c20_c21) and click

![clone](../../../../docs/images/clone.png)

Path of the application within the repository is **apps/sercom/spi/spi_eeprom_write_read/firmware** .

To build the application, refer to the following table and open the project using its IDE.

| Project Name      | Description                                    |

## Setting up the hardware

The following table shows the target hardware for the application projects.

| Project Name| Board|
|:---------|:---------:|
| sam_c21n_xpro.X | [SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamc21n-xpro)

### Setting up [SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamc21n-xpro)

- Connect a [mikroBUS Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO) to the EXT2 header
- Plug an [EEPROM 4 Click board](https://www.mikroe.com/eeprom-4-click) into the MikroBus socket of the [mikroBUS Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/ATMBUSADAPTER-XPRO)
- Connect the Debug USB port on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable

## Running the Application

1. Build and Program the application project using its IDE
2. LED indicates the success or failure:
    - LED is turned ON when the value read from the EEPROM matched with the written value
    - LED is turned OFF when the value read from the EEPROM did not match with the written value

Following table provides the LED name:

| Board      | LED Name |
| ---------- | ---------------- |--------- |
| [SAMC21N Xplained Pro Evaluation Kit](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamc21n-xpro) | LED0 |
