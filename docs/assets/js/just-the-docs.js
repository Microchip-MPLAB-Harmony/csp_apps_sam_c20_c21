The DIVAS takes dividend and divisor values and returns the quotient and remainder when it is used as divider. A simpler way of using the DIVAS is making it invisible to the programmer. This example application shows how to use the DIVAS Peripheral library to override C division and modulus operator. When compiler compiles the statements containing division operator (‘/’) and modulus operator (‘%’), it uses DIVAS APIs instead of C Library.

This example uses the I2C peripheral library in slave mode and emulates an EEPROM of 512 bytes. There are two pages each of size 256 bytes. I2C slave expects two bytes of memory address from the I2C master and the memory address can range from 0x00 to 0x1FF. I2C slave application supports following: . Byte Write: The I2C master sends the slave address, followed by two bytes of memory address. The slave provides the data present at the requested memory address. . Page Write: A page write is initiated the same way as a byte write, but the I2C master can write up-to 256 bytes (1 page). If more than 256 bytes are sent by the I2C master to the I2C slave, the memory address will “roll over” and previous data will be overwritten. The address “roll over” during write is from the last byte of the current page to the first byte of the same page. . Current Address Read: The internal memory address counter maintains the last address accessed during the last read or write operation, incremented by one. Once the device address with the read/write bit set to one is clocked in and acknowledged by the EEPROM, the data byte at the current address is serially clocked out. After reading the data from the current address, the I2C master sends NAK and generates a STOP condition. . Random Read: The I2C master writes the 2 byte memory address and then reads the data from that memory address. After reading the data, the I2C master sends NAK and generates a STOP condition. . Sequential Read: Sequential reads are initiated by either a current address read or a random address read. As long as the EEPROM receives an acknowledge, it will continue to increment the memory address and serially clock out sequential data bytes. When the memory address limit is reached (0x1FF), the memory address will “roll over” to 0x00 and the sequential read will continue. The sequential read operation is terminated when the I2C master sends a NAK and generates a STOP condition. . To run the application, two evaluation kits will be required - one acting as the I2C master and the other as the I2C slave. The I2C master application to be used for this demo application is available under apps/sercom/i2c/master/i2c_eeprom/firmware folder. I2C master writes an array of values to the I2C slave and verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written. . Downloading and building the application .

    "content": ". SERCOM SPI ping pong with DMA . This example demonstrates how to continuously transmit and receive data over a SPI interface using ping pong buffers with DMA. . Description . The DMA peripheral provides support to implement the ping-pong buffering. The DMA transmits and receives data from one pair of buffers, when the CPU works on the second pair. . When the DMA is transmitting data from the ping buffer, the CPU works on the pong buffer. When the DMA completes the transfer, it generates interrupt to indicate transfer completion from the ping buffer. DMA channel is automatically re-initialized to transmit data from the pong buffer while the CPU works on the ping buffer. . When the DMA is receiving data to the ping buffer, the CPU works on the the pong buffer.When DMA completes the transfer, it generates interrupt to indicate the availability of the data in the ping buffer. DMA channel is automatically re-initialized to receive data in the pong buffer while the CPU works on the ping buffer. . Application transmits an array of values and verifies the value transmitted by receiving the values back with loop back and comparing it to the value transmitted. This application requires that the MOSI output pin to be connected to the MISO input pin so that anything transmitted will also be received. . Downloading and building the application .

    "content": ". WDT timeout . This example shows how to generate a Watchdog timer reset by emulating a deadlock. . Description . This example application shows how the WDT peripheral library resets the watchdog timer by not feeding the watchdog on switch press. The application sets up the watchdog to reset the device. The application also sets up the timer to blink an LED to emulate a process. A user switch press forces the device to wait in an infinite loop to emulate a deadlock. As a result a device reset is triggered as the watchdog counter overflows the bounded value. . Downloading and building the application .
